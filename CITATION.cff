title: "Antennapedia regulates metallic silver wing scale development and cell shape in Bicyclus anynana butterflies."
abstract: This repository contains the software implementation for Prakash et al. 2021, Cell Reports. This includes a set of code written in SCM Scheme, awk and shell (Bash) and using FreeSnell (https://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/FreeSnell/) to theoretically model the broadband (silver/gold) reflectivity of a bilaminate butterfly wing scale scale with 3-layers (an air layer sandwiched between upper and lower laminae).
